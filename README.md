## The story 

  

This repository was version 0.1 for USTART after transitioning off of the sql & php proof of concept. 

It is a place where many friends came and left and worked together to learn multitudes of new things in the pursuit of entrepreneurship. 

For one both Go and Elastic search were self-taught from scratch on the spot. 

So, if you're asking yourself why it looks like the people who wrote it didn't know what they were doing; you're right, we didn't. 

Let it be known that as much as of a disasterpeice as this repo is it was not just functional, it was pretty damn robust as far as the front-end team was concerned. 

All in all, the mistakes we made here made way allowed for the breaking of ground on what was supposed to be our 0.2 which is ustart_micro. 

However, the project died before 0.2 could've been deployed, or even tested. 

  

This repo still stands as proud headstone of the memories shared on this project and as a testament to the human ability to adapt and learn.
